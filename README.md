R script for a reproducible analysis of logistic growth
Answers for Q1-Q3
Q1:
N0=879
r=0.01
K=60000000207
experiment.csv was used to generate these results.

Q2:
When t = 4980 min
for exponential growth: N(t)=879*e^(0.01*4980)=3.73*10^24
for logistic growth: N(t) = K = 60000000207
Thus the population under exponential growth is much larger than the population under logistic growth.

Q3:
